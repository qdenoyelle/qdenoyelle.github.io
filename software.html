                    <h1>The Sliding Frank-Wolfe (SFW) Algorithm</h1>
                    <p>The SFW algorithm is a greedy type algorithm based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (or Conditionnal Gradient Method (CGM)) that solves the
                        BLASSO over the space of Radon measures. It adds a new Dirac mass (or spike) at each iteration and consists in interleaving a convex and a
                        non convex step where both the amplitudes and positions of the spikes are moved to further decrease the objective function. We proved in
                        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06416">[1]</a> that it converges to the unique sparse solution of the BLASSO (finite sum of spikes) in
                        finite time.

                    <p>This algorithm is currently being implemented in Java by Amandine Evard (EPFL) as part of a master project. The goal is to developp an
                        ImageJ Plugin that can be used by biologists for Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) applications. You can find more details
